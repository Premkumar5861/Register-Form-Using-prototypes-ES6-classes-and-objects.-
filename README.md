# 📝 User Registration System (ES6 Classes & Prototypes)

A robust and clean **User Registration Form** project built to demonstrate core JavaScript concepts like **ES6 Classes**, **Prototypes**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. This project handles user input, validation, and dynamic UI updates.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **OOP Approach:** Implementation using both JavaScript Prototypes and modern ES6 Classes.
* **Real-time Validation:** Validates user inputs (Name, Email, Password) before processing.
* **Dynamic Data Handling:** Users are treated as objects, and their data is managed efficiently.
* **Responsive UI:** A clean, centered registration form designed for all screen sizes.
* **Event Driven:** Uses JavaScript Event Listeners to handle form submissions without page reloads.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the registration form.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling for a modern and professional look.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** * Classes & Constructors
* Prototypes & Inheritance
* DOM Manipulation

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Premkumar5861/Register-Form-Using-prototypes-ES6-classes-and-objects.git

```


2. **Open the Project:**
Locate the folder and open `index.html` in your browser.
3. **Test the Form:**
Fill in the registration details and check the console/UI for successful object creation.

## 💡 Concepts Covered

* **Prototypes:** Understanding how JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
* **ES6 Classes:** Using `class` and `constructor` to create blueprints for user objects.
* **Encapsulation:** Keeping user data and logic organized within objects.
